# CMPT318-HiddenMarkovModel

Here is the performance of anomaly detection systems based on the training and testing of
Hidden Markov Models using normal data and comparing these results to anomalous
data using the log-likelihood method. Principal Component Analysis is conducted to
choose the best suited variables for the experiment.
